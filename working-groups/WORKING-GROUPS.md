# AGNTCY Working Groups

Most community activity is organized into _working groups_.

When the need arises, a new working group can be created. See the
[working group processes](../WORKING-GROUP-PROCESSES.md) for working
group proposal and creation procedures.

The current working groups are:

| Group            | Design Docs | Slack Channel | Description                                                              
|------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| <TBD> | <TBD>       | <TBD>         | <TBD>
